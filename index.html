            <p>
                I made this project mainly because I was bored in the Web Design class that I was taking (I was done with the assignment and had a lot of time left). I noticed that the high school web design class had a website, but ours didn't. I decided to solve this problem, if even for myself. I enjoyed making this project and even got to show it off to a DIT class at school. <a href="https://isaacodes.github.io/ruckelwebdesign/">View project here</a>

            <span class="title">"Jeopardy!"</span>
            <p>
                I made this project because my language arts class played a game of "Jeopardy!" for review, but I noticed that the page was littered with ads and the game was small on the screen and, therefore, hard to read. I then made this program in my spare time at home for my Language Arts teacher. <a href="https://isaacodes.github.io/Jeapordy/index.html">View project here</a>

            <p>
                This is one of the projects that I am very proud of. Simplistic Design is an CSS and JavaScript  library to make the process of creating a web site a lot easier. Simplistic Design is an ongoing project, constantly evolving with web trends. Simplistic Design is, technically, customizable, it just won't be easy in the either compacted or thousand-line long CSS stylesheets. <a href="https://isaacodes.github.io/simplisticdesign" target="_blank">View project here</a>

Hopefully in the future I will have a way to add a comment feature to this page (or the blog I plan to open), but for now, email and CodePen will have to do. :D
