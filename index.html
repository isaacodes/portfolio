                                I made this project for my Web Design teacher in 8th grade. It is a basic overview of the web design course. I even got to show this website to some people in the class next door to get some of the seventh graders to take the course the next school year.

                                I made this web page for my 7th grade civics teacher, who also had his own fishing company. I saw his website and commented on some things wrong with it, and he told me to make something better. He didn't end up using it, but he liked it! <em>Works on mobile</em>

                        All of my web pages are fast. This means no unnecessary load time, quick and snappy transitions, and all while maintaining a pleasant user experience, and keeping good design.

                    <div class="title">Responsive</div>
                    <p>
                        All of the projects I undertake, unless only temporary or just for fun, are responsive, meaning that they will work on any device. This is important to maintain a good user experience.

                    <p>
                        As far as design goes, I stick to a relatively modern and flat design for my webpages. I add depth with the use of layers, parallax, and shadows. Colors are based on a pallete.

                    I am Isaac Maddox, a teenage web developer originally from Memphis, Tennessee. I first started programming when I was 9. The first programming languages I leared were HTML and CSS. I learned JavaScript when my dad saw a word scramble program I made using HTML hyperlinks and CSS, and decided that I was ready. I have been programming ever since, and I still thoroughly enjoy it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know 4 programming languages now, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using jQuery), and PHP (phpMyAdmin). You can see my "skills" to the left, along with how confident I am in them.
