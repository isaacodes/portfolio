        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>
            I do offer a web page development service. I take website requests through my <a href="mailto:isaacmaddox05@gmail.com">email</a> and will communicate with the client to ensure that the result is how they wanted it to turn out. Below is the pricing for a website:

        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to have a web site developed by me, simply e-mail me at <a href="mailto:isaacmaddox05@gmail.com">isaacmaddox05@gmail.com</a> and I will try to respond as soon as I can. Please remember: I do go to school so it might be a while before I respond to your message. In your email to me, please include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Name of website / company / product</li>
                <li>Attached Word document / Google Docs link to the text that you want, separated into sections for each individual page</li>
                <li>Requested completion date (please note: this date may not always be met)</li>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Any contact information that you want on the page</li>
                <li>Color palette for the website (can be sent as a picture, or as some form of color codes [hex, rgb, hsl])</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After I recieve your email, I will verify that all the information I need is included in the email. If I find any essential information missing, I will respond asking for this information, and the project could possibly be delayed. Once I recieve all the information I need, I will begin working on the project. After approximately one day of working on the project, based on the progress that I have made and what other events I may have going on, I will give you an estimated time frame for the completion of the project. I will always try to meet your requested completion date, but please understand that this may sometimes not be possible. Every time I complete a page for the project, I will email you the files in a compressed folder so that you can check the progress and make sure that you are satisfied. If you find anything wrong with it at all, please email me back. I do not charge any extra for fixing things, unless it entails a complete redesign, in which case I will determine at the time of the request for the redesign how much extra to charge (most likely around $5 - $10 more). After I have the page just the way you want it, I will continue with the rest of the pages. I will complete all of these pages, and then send you the final product. You will have the chance to look over the final product and make sure that you are satisfied. Again, email me again with any complaints that you may have. I will finalize the product and send you the files that you need to host the website. <strong>I do not offer hosting</strong>

        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            Below are the terms and conditions of me creating a website for any client:
        </p>
        <p class="noindent">
            - With permission from the client, I may use the website that I made in a showcase (my portfolio) to demonstrate work that I have done for other clients.<br/>
            - <sup>1</sup>All charges will be reviewed with the client at the end of the development process. Once all charges have been approved by both parties, the payment(s) may be made. All payment is expected up front, but otherwise can be paid at monthly intervals with a 0% interest rate. This time frame for the payment will be determined, if necessary. If payments are not made by the last month of the time frame, the client will be charged the original payment amounts plus an additional $10 per overdue month.<br/>
            - All code for the website will NOT be made open-source (i.e. put on GitHub or published in any way), but the code is accessible through most web browsers, and the client must understand this and agree to having the code possibly seen and copied by others, as I do <strong>not deal with copyright issues<sup>2</sup></strong><br/>
            - <sup>2</sup>I will not help in any cases of my code being plagiarized. Obviously, if I plagiarize code or images, I accept full responsibility for this. Any text that is copyright claimed and can be proven to have been sent by the client will not be dealt with by me, beyond my legal obligations.
